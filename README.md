# BirdAudioDetectionChallenge2016

Durinf the Challenge I tried various methodoly and came up with some creative algorithms. However, what turned out to produce the best results, was simply using AlexNet [2012] on spectrograms. Intrestingly, any further engineering of images that was supposed to enhance features or reduce noise either did not bring relevant improvement or was actually worsening the end result.

## The worst part (?)

My best result was obtained with ~15 minutes of coding. 

## The best part

By taking "out of a box" deep neural network like AlexNet one can get a fairly good results without a sweat.
